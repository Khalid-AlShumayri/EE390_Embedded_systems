# EE390_Embedded_systems
This repo. contains the LAB project of the course EE390 in addition to some Assembly codes

About the LAB Project:
This program takes a vector of data that represents speed of a wind turbine and calculate the output power. Then it performs some calculation (e.g., loss of load probability and ) after that stores the result in external RAM.
