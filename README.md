# EE390_Embedded_systems
This repo. contains the LAB project of the course EE390 in addition to some Assembly codes

About the LAB Project:
First, the program takes a vector of data that represents speed of a wind turbine and calculates the output power. In addition, it takes two vector of data namely, generation and demand vectors.Then, the program calculates loss-of-load expectation and probability. Finally, all the results will be save in externam RAM.
